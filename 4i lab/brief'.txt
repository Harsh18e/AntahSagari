Analysis and Simulation

Related concepts of fluid dynamics is used for example skin friction ,
sheer stress distribution and pressure distribution is studied for a more aerodynamic model.
The shape and weight distribution of the model crucially detemines its power efficiency and accuracy.

Currently Ansys student version is used for underwater simulation. by the use of
Ansys cfd Fluent simulation,
variation of skin friction, opposing drag and pressure with respect to velocity is analyzed.
Its mainly achieved by specifying material used ,boundary conditions ike invard water veocity,pressure isolation at side walls, are specified 
with a primitive 3d model.
